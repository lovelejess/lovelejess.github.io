title: About me

<h4> I am a <italics>software craftswoman. </italics></h4>
<p>I find that writing <b>automated tests</b> before production code is helpful to stay on task and deliver quality products. When I write code I <b>convey a story</b> so that others can understand it. I believe that <b>pull requests</b> are not a way to criticize your coworker's code, but are a way to gain new perspectives and learn from one another. I believe that <b>pair programming</b> is an effective way to share knowledge, mentor others, and get shit done. I <b>continuously integrate</b> by rebasing, making small commits, and push often.

<br>
<p>My current programming hobby is <b>iOS development</b>and mastering <b> angular. </b> I also help organize a local user group, <b>DSMWebGeeks</b>, which meets monthly. </p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I partake in <b>yoga, acrobatic yoga, rock climbing, biking, traveling</b>, and <b>food comas</b>.
</p>

<p>I work at <b>Pillar Technology</b> as a <b>software artisan</b>.</p>

<h4> Most importantly, I love what I do, but I also love when I'm not working. :) </h4>
