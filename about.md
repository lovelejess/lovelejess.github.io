<h4> I am a <italics>software craftswoman. </italics></h4>

<p>I am a software craftswoman that's passionate about delivering quality products through continuous integration and delivery, automated testing/test driven development, and fast customer feedback. I love asking the question, "What's the value add of producing feature x?" I am a continuous learner and enjoy working on different technologies.
<br>

<p>When I'm not coding, I partake in <b>yoga, rock climbing, biking, traveling</b>, and <b>food comas</b>.
</p>

<p>I work at <b>Slalom Consulting</b> as a <b>software consultant</b>.</p> I am a polyglot, but I have been mastering my craft in <b>iOS Development, & AWS Serverless Architecture. </b>

<h4> Most importantly, I love what I do, but I also love when I'm not working!</h4>
