Wow. Sorry. It's been a while. There really is no excuse why I haven't posted since my first blog. 

Summer has ended, WINTER IS COMING, so been trying to enjoy the outdoors as much as I can before I have to hibernate. I think my github contributions is directly correlated to how cold it is outside :) 

I've learned a lot of things since then! I want to be a keyboard whiz so I'm learning more about vim and bash to increase my productivity!

Here are **some cool tutorials and cheat sheets** that I have found useful in my **bash** and **vim**  adventures:

[Bash Interactive Tutorial](http://www.learnshell.org/)

[Explain Shell](http://explainshell.com/)

[Vim CheatSheet](http://vim.rtorr.com/)

Enter the command: `vimtutorial` in your terminal, & you have an interactive tutorial for vim!


So here's what I have learned today since it's fresh in my memory!

##What does 'set -e' do?

`set -e` causes the shell to exit if any subcommand returns a nonzero exit status

`set +e` no exit on a non-zero status

You can turn this on and off throughout a bash script, for example:

```
set -e
bash code #if this code returns a non zero exit status then the script will terminate
set +e
bash code #this code does not terminate on a non zero exit status
```
